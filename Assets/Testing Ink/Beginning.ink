L-KRON powers up, stutters and whirrs a bit, then settles down and turns to face Naomi. 
Oh! I do apologize for startling you, Mistress Steele. I beg you forgive my manners. # speaker: L-KRON
Wait... you know my name? # speaker: Naomi
Affirmative, Mistress Steele. #speaker: L-KRON
Please... just call me Naomi. # speaker: Naomi
Very well, Ms. Naomi. Yes, I am aware of your existence. Master Steele... I mean, your father, has informed me all about you. #speaker: L-KRON
...He did? # speaker: Naomi
Most certainly, Ms. Naomi. And before he last shut me down, he informed me that you would be the one to power me back on. # speaker: L-KRON
That was quite an assumption on his part. # speaker: Naomi
That may well be so, Ms. Naomi. But it appears his assumption was valid. You did power me on, after all. And just as well, for we have a lot of work to do. # speaker: L-KRON
I can see that... but I don't have a clue how to run these places. Most I ever did was run plates from the kitchen. And that was years ago. # speaker: Naomi
Oh, well I am sure you will be pleased to know that is most of what the work entails! I will take care of the rest. And if you need a refresher, you may ask me anytime. # speaker: L-KRON
I'm starting to think we'll make a good team, Mr... er, what was your name again? # speaker: Naomi
Oh! I do beg your pardon for my insolence. I am L-KRON 385, a helper automaton built for automating tasks in hospitality establishments. # speaker: L-KRON
That's a bit of a mouthful, don't you think? # speaker: Naomi
Oh. Well, I suppose you are correct, now that you mention it.  #speaker: L
How about I just call you "L" for short? # speaker: Naomi
Very well, Ms. Naomi. "L" is an acceptable shorthand. #speaker: L
Wonderful! So, L, how do I get started running this place? # speaker: Naomi
There is much to go through. Fortunately, we do have enough time to go over the basics before we open for the day. What would you like to know? #speaker: L
